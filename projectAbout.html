							<p>Rummagem is an app where users can browse yard sales and add them to their personal agenda, find their itinerary populated on a dynamic map, and post their own yard sale. I worked with a Ruby on Rails backend, Vue.js frontend, Mapbox API, and Cloudinary API.
			        </p>

                One cool feature that was fun to work with was Mapbox API geocoding which allows the user to pass in a string address and converts the address into longitude and latitude coordinates so that the marker and map function works.
                Another cool feature I had fun with was the diamond favicon in the page title, this icon is also repeated as a marker for the map function. The banner picture was a fun barbie yardsale photoshoot I did. You can check this project out on Github.

               The most difficult issue to overcome while building Rummagem was project management. I initially was following my Kanban workflow. However, as soon as I started my frontend the first thing I did was install the favicon and then I installed a beautiful theme, most of which is now gone. I was just really excited to start seeing everything. I learned to plan more and spend more time in the backend building out features, before jumping into CSS and losing hours on styling rows and backgrounds. I also learned to take user experience into account and have some features that I would change.
